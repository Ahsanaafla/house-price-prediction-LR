## Dataset
Housing.csv from Kaggle dataset "harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction".

## Steps
1. Load and clean data (drop some categorical features).
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Fit linear regression models using statsmodels and sklearn.
4. Normalize features with MinMaxScaler and refit models.
5. Evaluate models and visualize results.

## How to Run
- Install required libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, statsmodels, matplotlib.
- Run the notebook/script to train and evaluate models.
- Use provided plotting code to visualize predictions and residuals.
